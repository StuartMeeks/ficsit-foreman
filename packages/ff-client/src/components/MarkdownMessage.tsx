 * Renders the foreman's reply as Markdown — headings, lists, tables (via GFM),
 * inline/blocked code, links and emphasis. Used for both streamed replies and
 * rehydrated history (same render path), so reloaded conversations look identical.
 *
 * Raw HTML is intentionally NOT enabled (no rehype-raw), so model output cannot
 * inject markup; react-markdown also sanitises link URLs to safe protocols.
 * Partial Markdown that arrives mid-stream renders gracefully — the parser emits
 * what it can and reflows as more text lands.

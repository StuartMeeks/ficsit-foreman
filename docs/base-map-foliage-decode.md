# FGFoliage decode — rendering the missing world foliage (#246 slice: "other trees")

> **Status:** spec / agreed design, pre-implementation.
> **Parent:** [#246 base-map renderer](./base-map-renderer.md) — this is the "other tree species"
> follow-up called out in §6 (Flora). **Host-build only** (CUE4Parse + a game install; see the
> renderer doc for the winbuild workflow).

## 1. Problem

The renderer's flora pass (§6 of [base-map-renderer.md](./base-map-renderer.md)) only sees foliage
placed as stock `FoliageInstancedStaticMeshComponent` (~19 k instances) plus individual
`StaticMeshComponent`s. It renders coral and Titan-Forest trees from that set.

But the **bulk of Satisfactory's world foliage — ~71 k components holding ~3.3 M instances —
lives in a custom component, `FGFoliageInstancedSMC`**, which the collector never reads. Ferns,
grass, bushes, coral, dead trunks and most tree species (DypsisPalm, DesertBush, …) are all in
this set. They are entirely invisible on the map today. This is the root cause of "missing trees".

Confirmed empirically: a coordinate the player reported as having a tree within 2–3 m
(`109300, −129300`) had **zero** readable foliage within 400 m before the fix; after the fix it
resolves ground-cover at 0.8 m and `SM_Fern_01` at 3.0 m, plus dense surrounding foliage.

## 2. Root cause & decode (the hard-won part)

`FGFoliageInstancedSMC` is a `UHierarchicalInstancedStaticMeshComponent` subclass (its tagged
properties — `NumBuiltInstances`, `SortedInstances`, `InstanceReorderTable`, `ClusterTree` — are the
HISM set), but **CUE4Parse does not know that**, so it builds a generic `UObject` and never
deserialises the instance transform buffer. Two things are needed to read it correctly:

### 2a. Register the class

```csharp
// GameAssetProvider ctor, before Initialize()
ObjectTypeRegistry.RegisterClass("FGFoliageInstancedSMC",
    typeof(UHierarchicalInstancedStaticMeshComponent));
```

`ObjectTypeRegistry` is in namespace `CUE4Parse.UE4.Assets` (not `.Exports`). With this, CUE4Parse
runs the ISM/HISM `Deserialize` path and `PerInstanceSMData` is populated. `export is
UInstancedStaticMeshComponent` then also returns true (HISM ⊂ ISM), so the collector's existing
instanced branch catches it.

### 2b. The world-position formula is *different* from stock foliage

This is the trap. For **stock** `FoliageInstancedStaticMeshComponent`, world pos =
`TranslatedInstanceSpaceOrigin + instance.Translation` (see §6). For **`FGFoliageInstancedSMC`
that formula is wrong** and produces a collapsed, doubled mess. The correct decode:

- `TranslatedInstanceSpaceOrigin` is **a red herring** — it equals `instance[0].Translation`, a
  small local value (±~30 m), *not* a cell offset. Adding it double-counts.
- Per-instance `.Translation` values are **local to the owning cell** (±~30 m spread within a
  component — a realistic bush/tree cluster).
- The **km-scale cell offset lives on the owning actor.** Each `FGFoliageInstancedSMC` is owned by
  an `InstancedFoliageActor_<...>` whose `RootComponent0` (a `SceneComponent`, reached via the
  component's `AttachParent`) carries the cell world position in its `RelativeLocation`
  (e.g. `(−252800, −67200, 3200)`).

**Correct world position:**

```
world = AttachParent(RootComponent).RelativeLocation  +  instance.Translation
```

Rotation = `instance.Rotation.Rotator()`, scale = `instance.Scale3D` (both read correctly).

Evidence trail (probe `treeat`): with this formula, foliage spreads correctly across the whole
map, instance[0]==origin per component, scales are sane (0.3–2.9), and the reported coordinate
resolves the expected dense foliage patch. CUE4Parse version is irrelevant — no upstream commit
adds Satisfactory foliage support (a `UInstancedStaticMeshComponent` fix at `fbae35b5` is
Lord-of-Mysteries-specific); this decode must live in our code.

## 3. Rendering plan — trees & large foliage only

Rendering all 3.3 M instances is heavy and would visually swamp the terrain with grass. **Scope:
draw only trees and large foliage** (the visually meaningful canopy); drop grass / ground-cover /
small plants. Delivery = "more trees".

- **Integration point:** `SceneCollector.TryAddMesh`. The existing instanced branch already loops
  `PerInstanceSMData` and emits `PlacedMesh` with `kind` (coral/tree). Extend it to:
  1. Recognise `FGFoliageInstancedSMC` (post-registration it is a `UInstancedStaticMeshComponent`,
     so `export is UInstancedStaticMeshComponent` already fires — but its position formula differs).
  2. Compute the cell offset from `AttachParent.RelativeLocation` **when the export type is
     `FGFoliageInstancedSMC`**, and use `cellOffset + translation` instead of
     `TranslatedInstanceSpaceOrigin + translation`. Keep the stock formula for stock foliage.
- **Classification / include-filter:** reuse the `--flora` include-filter mechanism. Add the tree
  and large-foliage paths under `/Environment/Foliage/Trees/*` (DypsisPalm, Kapok, DioTree,
  GreenTree, BluePalm, Bamboo, …) and large `/Bush/*` / large `/Coral/*` that appear in FGFoliage.
  Everything under `/Foliage/Grass/`, `/Foliage/SmallFoliage/`, `DeadVegetation` ground-cover is
  **excluded** by default. Filtering happens *before* rasterising, so the 3.3 M never all raster.
- **Rasterisation:** unchanged — flora tops z-buffered into the height grid, `kind` tree=2 /
  coral=1, `FLORAH` low cut, trunk/foliage split, trunk cross-section fill (§6). New tree species
  get the same treatment; `--tree-part` still applies.
- **Colours:** placeholder tree foliage/trunk colours for now (per-mesh textures are a later step,
  as with existing flora).

## 4. Slices

1. **Decode + probe — DONE.** `ObjectTypeRegistry` registration in `GameAssetProvider`; `treeat`
   probe proving the cell-offset formula.
2. **Collector read — DONE.** `SceneCollector.TryAddMesh` reads `FGFoliageInstancedSMC` with the
   cell-offset formula; include-filter defaults to trees + coral. Counts logged. (~150k flora.)
3. **Bushes, textures, double-render — DONE.** Large bushes added to the filter; per-mesh textures
   confirmed working; HLOD double-render fixed; artifact updated. See §6 below.

## 5. Slice 3 outcomes

- **Double-render (audited via `probe florasrc`).** FGFoliage is **disjoint** from stock foliage —
  none of the 13 meshes present in more than one component type involve `FGFoliageInstancedSMC`, so
  the FGFoliage addition introduces no double-planting. The audit did surface a *pre-existing* issue:
  **HLOD components** (`HLODInstancedStaticMeshComponent`) are 1:1 low-detail proxies that
  double-planted 13 tree/rock meshes (e.g. `SM_TitanTree_01`: StaticMeshComponent=73 **and** HLOD=73).
  Fixed by skipping any component whose type contains `HLOD` in `TryAddMesh` — the real instances
  remain. (~500 proxy instances dropped.)
- **Flora scope — now all foliage by default.** The filter was first widened to add large bushes
  (`/Environment/Bush/`), then — once a full-map render of *everything* was measured at **~114 s
  full-res (downsample 2) for ~2.6M instances** — the default was opened to the whole flora set:
  `DefaultFloraFolders = ["/Environment/Foliage/", "/Environment/Bush/"]` (Coral, Trees, Grass,
  Flowers, all `/SmallFoliage/`, plus the large bushes). Small foliage reads as ground cover, not
  clutter, at true scale. A `/Coral/` segment marks coral; everything else is the tree kind.
  `--flora "/Foliage/Trees/,/Environment/Bush/"` narrows to a trees-only map. The FGFoliage decode
  is what makes rendering the full set affordable.
- **Per-mesh textures — already implemented, now verified.** `MeshGeometryCache` samples each mesh
  section's material albedo (`MaterialColourSampler`) into `TriangleColour`; the rasteriser uses it,
  falling back to `ObjectPalette` only for coral (emissive glow the albedo misses → fixed purple) and
  DesertRock (virtual-textured, doesn't decode). A full render sampled **146 of 191** unique meshes;
  the rest are the deliberate palette fallbacks. Bushes inherit the same path.

## 6. Risks / open questions (remaining)

- **Performance:** trees + bushes = ~178k instances; raster time is acceptable at ds2. No cap needed
  yet — revisit if further families are added.
- **Coral colour** stays a fixed purple by design (albedo misses the emissive). Sampling it would
  read green/brown; left as-is.
- **Canopy scale.** The big titan-forest canopies render at true scale and read as large blobs; a
  density/scale pass is possible but not currently warranted.

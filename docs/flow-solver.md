# Flow solver — steady-state production reconciliation (#148 + #126)

## Problem

`get_production` reports *configured* capacity (recipe rate × clock × boost) and `get_power`
reports per-circuit balance, but neither answers the real question: **is each machine
actually getting what it needs, and if not, why?** A machine is **starved** when an input is
delivered below its required rate (even 99% counts); **backed-up** when an output exceeds
what downstream can take. Both are *rate* judgements, with a caller-supplied **tolerance**
(default ±5%) so near-balance isn't flagged.

Answering this means reconciling the whole material-flow network at steady state:
sources (extractors/producers) feed belts/pipes through splitters and mergers into machine
inputs, contended by competing consumers and capped by belt/pipe throughput; a starved
machine produces less, which propagates to *its* consumers — a feedback loop requiring a
fixed-point solve.

## Scope & non-goals

- **Steady-state rates**, not tick-level belt simulation (round-robin phase, manifold fill
  transients are out — not useful and not faithfully simulable).
- Models: source output rates, machine input demands, **belt/pipe throughput caps** (by
  tier), **smart/programmable splitter sort-rules** (slice A), plain-splitter distribution,
  merger fan-in, **shared-supply contention**, and **throughput feedback** (under-fed →
  reduced output → propagated).
- Fluids: pipe flow capacity + headlift/pump direction (the data lands as part of this work,
  per old slice C); v1 may treat pipe headlift conservatively (note any simplification).

## Architecture & layering

Three pieces, keeping the neutral libs game-data-free:

1. **`@foreman/sf-flow` — new pure solver lib.** Operates on an *abstract* flow network:
   nodes (sources with per-item output rate; sinks with per-item demand; pass-through), edges
   (directed, per-item, with a throughput cap), splitter nodes (with sort-rules), mergers.
   Input is plain numbers — **no game data, no save types** — so it is unit-testable in
   isolation and reusable. Output: delivered rate per (node, item) + per-node throughput
   fraction, converged to a fixed point.
2. **`sf-save-data-graph` (pure) — the directed-flow substrate.** Already provides edge
   orientation, belt-chain propagation, `upstreamOf`/`downstreamOf`, `splitterRulesOf`.
   Stays game-data-free.
3. **`sf-mcp` — the adapter + tool.** Builds the abstract network from the graph + the
   **effective-game-data seam** (`getEffectiveGameData`: recipe in/out rates, belt/extractor
   rates; #172 later multiplies modifiers in here), runs the solver, and shapes the
   `find_bottlenecks` response.

## Algorithm (fixed-point iteration)

```
throughput[machine] = 1 for all machines            // assume full
repeat until max change < ε (or iteration cap):
  for each source: emit item X at rate = baseOutput[X] × throughput[source]
  propagate downstream over the directed graph:
    - belts/pipes: carry min(incoming, capacity)
    - splitters: distribute by sort-rules (filtered/any/overflow); plain = even split
                 across outputs that can accept, demand-weighted
    - mergers: sum inputs
  deliveredIn[machine][X] = flow arriving at that input
  throughput'[machine] = min(1, minₓ deliveredIn[X] / requiredIn[X])
converge → delivered rates + throughput per machine
```

- **Convergence:** monotone-ish; cap iterations (e.g. 100) and ε (e.g. 0.1%). Loops/ambiguous
  direction (from the substrate's `complete=false`) → mark those machines `unknown`, never a
  false verdict.
- **Contention:** a source feeding N consumers splits by demand share; if total demand >
  supply, all downstream scale down — captured naturally by the fixed point.

## Outputs / API

- **`sf-flow`**: `solve(network, { tolerance }) → { delivered, throughput, verdicts }`.
- **`find_bottlenecks` MCP tool** (`inputSchema: { tolerance?, item?, savePath }`): per
  machine, a compact verdict — `ok` / `starved` (which input, delivered vs required, and the
  **upstream cause**: missing source / out-filtered branch / belt cap / contention) /
  `backed-up` / `unpowered` (overloaded circuit, no battery buffer — slice B) / `idle` (no
  recipe) / `unknown` (unresolved direction). Aggregated and token-conscious — **never a
  graph dump**. `tolerance` default 0.05.

## Resolved decisions (sign-off)

1. **Solver home:** a new pure `@foreman/sf-flow` lib (abstract network in, delivered rates
   out) — game-data-free, unit-testable, reusable.
2. **Plain-splitter distribution:** demand-weighted (each branch drawn proportional to its
   downstream demand, capped by belt throughput).
3. **Fluids:** head-lift modelling (shared-network max head lift + actor elevation), not
   capacity-only.

### Head lift (landed)

Head lift **is now in the dataset**: the offline C# extractor was extended to read building
head lift into `Building.headLiftMetres`, and the solver cuts a fluid leg that rises above its
pipe network's **shared** head lift — `max(elevation + maxHeadLift)` over the connected
component's sources/pumps/buffers, using each building's *maximum* head lift so only the
genuinely-unreachable is blocked. Actor `location.z` (already parsed) supplies vertical lift.

Deferred (not blocking): finer **per-instance** pump/valve modelling from the save — valve
`mDefaultFlowLimit`, pump direction/position — which would refine per-leg budgets beyond the
building-max approximation. Confirmed save shapes if pursued: valve `mDefaultFlowLimit`
(Float), pump/valve `mFluidBox`, pump `mIsProducing`.

## Delivery (all shipped — closed #148 + #126)

1. **Directed-flow substrate** — `upstreamOf`/`downstreamOf` in `sf-save-data-graph`. ✅
2. **`@foreman/sf-flow`** — the pure solver + a fixture test-suite (chains, splits, merges,
   contention, smart-filter, belt-cap, head-lift-limited leg, loop→unknown). ✅
3. **effective-game-data seam** in `sf-mcp` (recipe rates today; #172 fills 1.2 modifiers
   behind the same seam). ✅
4. **Head-lift data** — the C# extractor now emits `Building.headLiftMetres`; the solver
   honours shared-network head lift. ✅ (Per-instance pump/valve save modelling deferred.)
5. **adapter + `find_bottlenecks`** tool + real-save smoke tests. ✅

## Resolved decisions

1. **New `sf-flow` lib vs a module inside `sf-mcp`?** → A pure, standalone lib — testable, and
   the abstract-network boundary is clean.
2. **Plain-splitter distribution** at steady state → **demand-weighted** even split (each
   branch drawn proportional to its downstream demand, capped by belt throughput).
3. **Fluids** → head-lift via shared-network max head lift + actor elevation (not capacity-only,
   not per-instance valve modelling).

Resolved: belt/pipe capacity is available (`Building.conveyorSpeedPerMin` / `pipeFlowPerMin`,
extractors via `extractionRatePerMin`) — used to cap edges.

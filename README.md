# FICSIT Foreman

FICSIT Foreman is an AI companion for the game **Satisfactory**. It acts as your on-site
foreman: it knows the game, tracks where you are in it, and hands you a human-scaled
next step instead of an overwhelming blueprint — keeping the maths off your plate so
you can stay in the game. The foreman's personality is chosen by you during
onboarding; there is no hardcoded character.

This repository is a monorepo. It delivers the **game-data backbone** (an MCP server that
answers production questions accurately from real game data), the **foreman chat backend**
(a chat proxy — Anthropic or any OpenAI-compatible provider — with the foreman persona and
work-order persistence), and a **web UI** to talk to the foreman. All three run as services
in one Docker Compose project.

## What's in this release

| Package | Status | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [`packages/sf-mcp`](./packages/sf-mcp) | **Built** | The unified MCP server: game-data graph tools (parses `en-US.json` into an embedded Kùzu graph) **and** live save-game tools (save-file parser exposing pioneer location, inventory, unlocks, milestones, remaining collectibles) from one endpoint. Works standalone with Claude Desktop. |
| [`packages/ff-server`](./packages/ff-server) | **Built** | Express backend: LLM chat proxy (Anthropic or OpenAI-compatible) with the foreman persona, MCP tool use, and stateful work-order persistence (see [`docs/work-orders.md`](./docs/work-orders.md)). |
| [`packages/ff-client`](./packages/ff-client) | **In progress** | React UI (Phase 3): foreman chat (streaming), active work-order panel, history, and onboarding/settings. Served on port `8725`. |

> FICSIT Foreman runs as a **Docker Compose project** named `foreman`: the `sf-mcp` server
> and backend are separate services in the one project (plus the web UI), so Docker
> Desktop keeps them grouped together under one start/stop.

## Quick start (Docker — recommended)

FICSIT Foreman ships as a Docker image with the latest **stable** game data baked in, so it runs
with **zero setup — you don't even need to find your game files**.

### Windows (Docker Desktop)

Most Satisfactory players are on Windows, so here's the full path:

1. Install **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)** and start
   it. (It sets up the WSL 2 backend for you — just accept the prompts and let it finish.)
2. Save the [`compose.yaml`](./compose.yaml) from this repo into a folder (or copy this):

   ```yaml
   name: foreman
   services:
     sf-mcp:
       image: ghcr.io/stuartmeeks/foreman-sf-mcp:latest
       container_name: foreman-sf-mcp
       ports:
         - "8723:8723"
       restart: unless-stopped
   ```

   *(The snippet above is the MCP server on its own — all you need to use FICSIT Foreman
   from Claude Desktop. The full [`compose.yaml`](./compose.yaml) in this repo runs the
   whole stack: the `sf-mcp` server, the `server` backend (`:8724`), and the `web` UI (`:8725`).
   To run it all and chat with the foreman in your browser, set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or
   enter a key in the UI's settings) and run `docker compose up -d --build`, then open
   **<http://localhost:8725>**.)*
3. Open a terminal in that folder and run:

   ```powershell
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   *(GUI alternative: in Docker Desktop's **Images** tab, search
   `ghcr.io/stuartmeeks/foreman-sf-mcp`, click **Run**, expand **Optional settings**, set the
   name to `foreman-sf-mcp` and the host port to `8723`.)*
4. Confirm it's running: open **<http://localhost:8723/health>** — you should see
   `{"status":"ok","version":"1.2.3.0"}`.

**Start and stop it** any time from Docker Desktop's **Containers** tab (the `foreman`
project), or with `docker compose stop` and `docker compose start` — this keeps the
containers in place (they stay listed in Docker Desktop, just stopped). Use
`docker compose down` only when you want to **remove** the containers; your data
survives in the `foreman-db` volume either way. **Update** to a newer build with
`docker compose pull` then `docker compose up -d`.

### macOS / Linux

Use the same `compose.yaml` (`docker compose up -d`), or a one-off container:

```bash
docker run -d --name foreman-sf-mcp -p 8723:8723 ghcr.io/stuartmeeks/foreman-sf-mcp:latest
```

> **Note:** the server speaks the MCP **Streamable-HTTP** protocol at
> `http://localhost:8723/mcp` — that endpoint is for MCP clients, not a web browser (a
> browser GET returns `405`). Use `/health` to check it's alive. It has **no
> authentication**, so keep it on your own machine or LAN, never the public internet.

## Using a specific game version (optional)

The image bundles the latest **stable** data. To use something else, set these in
`compose.yaml` (`environment:` / `volumes:`) or via `docker run -e` / `-v`:

- **Experimental channel:** `SATISFACTORY_GAME_CHANNEL=experimental`.
- **Your exact install:** mount it read-only and point the server at it —
  `-v "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Satisfactory:/game:ro"` plus
  `-e SATISFACTORY_GAME_DIR=/game`.

Common install roots:

| Platform / store | Path |
|---|---|
| Steam (Windows) | `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Satisfactory` |
| Epic (Windows) | `C:/Program Files/Epic Games/SatisfactoryExperimental` |
| Steam (Linux) | `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Satisfactory` |

---

## Run from source (Node.js)

Prefer not to use Docker, or want to develop on FICSIT Foreman? You'll need **Node.js 22+** and
**npm 10+** (Windows / macOS / Linux).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StuartMeeks/ficsit-foreman
cd ficsit-foreman
npm install
npm run build
npm test

# Try a tool against the bundled stable data (no game install needed):
npm run inspect:game-data -- total_raw_inputs '{"item":"Reinforced Iron Plate","targetPerMinute":5}'

# Run the unified sf-mcp server over HTTP (defaults to port 8723):
MCP_TRANSPORT=http npm run start:mcp
```

To wire the server into Claude Desktop over stdio, see
[`packages/sf-mcp/README.md`](./packages/sf-mcp/README.md).

## Configuration

All optional — by default the server serves the bundled **stable** game data.

**MCP server** (`packages/sf-mcp`):

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `SATISFACTORY_GAME_CHANNEL` | Which bundled channel to use: `stable` (default) or `experimental`. |
| `SATISFACTORY_DOCS_PATH` | Full path to your own `en-US.json`. Highest priority. |
| `SATISFACTORY_GAME_DIR` | Your Satisfactory install root; the docs path is derived from it. |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | `stdio` (default, for Claude Desktop) or `http` to listen on a network port. |
| `MCP_HTTP_HOST` | HTTP bind host when `MCP_TRANSPORT=http` (default `0.0.0.0`). |
| `MCP_HTTP_PORT` | HTTP port when `MCP_TRANSPORT=http` (default `8723`). |
| `SAVE_FILE_PATH` | Optional fixed save (legacy/dev): path to a `.sav` to serve the save-game tools from. |
| `SAVE_DATA_DIR` | Directory host-injected `savePath` arguments must live under (the shared saves volume). |

**Backend** (`packages/ff-server`):

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `anthropic` (native Claude, default) or `openai` (OpenAI-compatible). |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | Hosted-tier key for the chosen provider. If unset, clients pass their own via the `x-anthropic-api-key` header. |
| `LLM_MODEL` | Model (default `claude-sonnet-4-6` / `gpt-4.1`). |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | OpenAI-compatible base URL (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Gemini-compat, Azure). |
| `MCP_URL` | Where the backend reaches the unified sf-mcp server, game-data + save tools (Compose: `http://sf-mcp:8723/mcp`; bare metal default `http://127.0.0.1:8723/mcp`). |
| `SAVE_DATA_DIR` | Directory where uploaded playthrough saves are stored; shared with sf-mcp so it can read each save by the path the backend injects. |
| `PORT` | Backend HTTP port (default `8724`). |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database connection (default `file:./dev.db`; Docker `file:/data/foreman.db`). For Postgres, use a `postgresql://` URL and switch the schema's datasource provider. |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Signs account session cookies. If unset, the server generates one on first start and persists it in the data volume (single-node deployments work out of the box). Set it explicitly (`openssl rand -base64 32`) for multi-instance or Postgres deployments. |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | Public origin the app is served from (for correct cookies behind a proxy). Optional; derived from the request if unset. |
| `HISTORY_WINDOW` | Most-recent messages sent per chat request (default `20`). |

> The legacy `ANTHROPIC_*` variables still work when `LLM_PROVIDER` is `anthropic`.

### Using a different LLM provider

The foreman runs on Anthropic by default but works with any OpenAI-compatible
frontier provider. Set the provider on the server (covers everyone), or pick one
per player in the web UI's **Settings** (provider + model + your own key). For
example, to run the whole server on OpenRouter:

```bash
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
LLM_API_KEY=sk-or-...
LLM_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
LLM_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5   # or any model OpenRouter offers
```

Tool-calling quality varies by model — the foreman leans on tools heavily, so a
strong frontier model gives the best results.

Resolution order for game data: `SATISFACTORY_DOCS_PATH` → `SATISFACTORY_GAME_DIR` →
bundled channel (`SATISFACTORY_GAME_CHANNEL`) → empty dataset with a warning. See
[`.env.example`](./.env.example) for the complete list.
